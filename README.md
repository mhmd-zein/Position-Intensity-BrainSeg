# Position-Intensity-BrainSeg
This repository contains the implementation of a brain tissue segmentation approach combining two conventional methods:

**Multi-Atlas Segmentation**: A position-based approach that uses atlases to guide the segmentation process.
**Tissue Models**: An intensity-based approach that utilizes tissue-specific intensity information to improve segmentation accuracy.
# Overview
The project focuses on the integration of these two approaches to enhance the segmentation of brain tissues. By combining the spatial information from multi-atlas segmentation with the intensity patterns from tissue models, we aim to achieve more accurate segmentation results for different brain tissues.
